This repository contains the latest version of the AudioDome Module, tutorial content, and a sample task (with some data).

# The Module
All the classes to build and send commands to the SpatialAudioCreator software are included in a single Python module file that is accompanied by a communication parameter setup file:<br> 
&emsp;-AudioDome_Module.py<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;module classes<br> 
&emsp;-AudioDome_Communication_Setup.py<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;communication variables<br> 

# Tutorial content
  You can find the slides and recordings of the workshop presented at 'Methods Lunch Presentation' in the Tutorial folder.<br>
  Recordings of that session are accessible in this [link](https://youtu.be/mkM5U0-KhDs).

# Sample task and data
  A simplified version of the elevation discrimination task with some data is included in the 'Sample Task' folder.<br>
  This task was part of the AudioDome assessment project and is described in [Focality of sound source placement by higher (ninth) order ambisonics and perceptual effects of spectral reproduction errors](https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0036226) in Experiment 3.
