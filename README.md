This repository contains the latest version of the AudioDome Module, tutorial content, and a sample task (with some data).

# The Module
All the classes to build and send commands to the SpatialAudioCreator software are included in a single Python module file that is accompanied by a communication parameter setup file:<br> 
&emsp;-AudioDome_Module.py<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;module classes<br> 
&emsp;-AudioDome_Communication_Setup.py<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;communication variables<br> 

  # Tutorial content
  You can find the slides and recordings of the workshop presented at 'Methods Lunch Presentation' in the Tutorial folder.<br>
  Recordings of that session are accessible in this [link](https://youtu.be/mkM5U0-KhDs).

  # Sample task and data
  A simplified version of the elevation discrimination task with some data is included in the 'Sample Task' folder.<br>
  This task was part of the AudioDome assessment project and is described in [Focality of sound source placement by higher (9th) order ambisonics and perceptual effects of spectral reproduction errors](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.07.606870v3.abstract) in Experiment 3.
